* "Estimation of Time Series Models Using Generalized Spectral Distribution Function", 2021 (Job Market Paper, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y-TzaeBWhJxF2_vBcKMOcqI_HZKAzwsO/view?usp=sharing">Latest draft!</a> )
  * Abstract: Univariate processes with non-fundamental representations have been employed to characterize nonlinear dynamics driven from predictable future innovations, which are of promising applications in Macroeconomics and Finance. In this paper, I propose a novel estimation technique of general linear time series which are possibly non-invertible and non-causal relying on the dependence structure of residuals. The generalized spectral cumulative function is considered to capture the general dependence of non-Gaussian residuals. The loss function is constructed by means of an L2 distance between the dependence measure in the unrestricted case and the one conjectured in the restricted case under the iid assumption. The information at all quantiles is used to achieve model identification. This method yields consistent estimates of the model parameters without imposing stringent conditions on the higher-order moments of innovations. Due to the non-differentiability of the original loss function, the asymptotic distribution of the estimates is approached by using a smoothed cumulative distribution function to approximate the indicator function. The efficiency improvement can be achieved by properly choosing the scaling parameter for residuals. Finite sample properties are studied through Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application of this approach is provided by fitting the daily trading volume of Microsoft stock by autoregressive models with non-causal representation. Another empirical application on financial series will be included to illustrate the ability of non-causal process in modeling local explosive behaviours. The flexibility of the cumulative distribution function permits the proposed method to be extended to a more general dependence structure where innovations are conditional mean or quantile independent.

* "QAR-based Noncausality Test", 2021 
  * Abstract: Quantile autoregression (QAR) model has been a more powerful tool than conventional regression techniques based on second order moments for time series. A new method to test for noncausality in the non-Gaussian process is proposed by applying misspecification test of linear QAR model over different quantiles on the process under iid assumption. In the paper we demonstrate that linear non-Gaussian process can display "nonlinear" behavior and admits at least one nonlinear quantile representation conditional on past observations. On the contrary, causal model produces constant QAR estimates at any quantile. Some simulations have been conducted to illustrate this methodology. In the Monte Carlo experiment, we compare different specification tests for dynamic quantiles with Kolmogorov-Simirnov constancy test in terms of power of detecting noncausality. The methodology is applied to two empirical examples in stock markets. Moreover, this method can be used to test for noninvertibility in non-Gaussian moving average models. The potential estimation of noncausal processes using extreme quantiles is mentioned in the paper and need further investigation.
