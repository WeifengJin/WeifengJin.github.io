*"Estimation of Time Series Models Using Generalized Spectral Distribution Function"</a>, 2021 (Job Market Paper)
  * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel estimation technique of general linear time series which are possibly non-invertible and non-causal based on measurement of independence of residuals. The loss function exploits the information of dependence contained in the empirical cumulative distribution of the residuals. We adopt spectral cumulative function as a measure of dependence. The loss function is constructed by Cram\'er-von Mises transformation of a weighted sum of dependence measure at all possible lags. The information at all quantiles is used to achieve parameter identification. We show the consistency of the proposed estimator without imposing conditions on higher order moments of innovations under iid structure. The asymptotic distribution of the estimator is investigated by using a smoothed cumulative distribution function to approximate the indicator function due to non-differentiability of the original loss function. Finite sample properties are studied in Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is illustrated by fitting daily trading volume of Microsoft stock from 6/3/1996 to 5/26/1999 by a noncausal AR(1) model.
