* "Estimation of Time Series Models Using Generalized Spectral Distribution Function", 2021 (Job Market Paper)
  * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel estimation technique of general linear time series which are possibly non-invertible and non-causal based on measurement of independence of residuals. The loss function exploits the information of dependence contained in the empirical cumulative distribution of the residuals. We adopt spectral cumulative function as a measure of dependence. The loss function is constructed by Cram\'er-von Mises transformation of a weighted sum of dependence measure at all possible lags. The information at all quantiles is used to achieve parameter identification. We show the consistency of the proposed estimator without imposing conditions on higher order moments of innovations under iid structure. The asymptotic distribution of the estimator is investigated by using a smoothed cumulative distribution function to numerically approximate the indicator function due to non-differentiability of the original loss function. Finite sample properties are studied in Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is illustrated by fitting daily trading volume of Microsoft stock from 6/3/1996 to 5/26/1999 by a noncausal AR(1) model.

* "QAR-based Noncausality Test", 2021 
  * Abstract: Quantile autoregression (QAR) model has been a more powerful tool than conventional regression techniques based on second order moments for time series. A new method to test for noncausality in the non-Gaussian process is proposed by applying misspecification test of linear QAR model over different quantiles on the process under iid assumption. In the papaer we demonstrate that linear non-Gaussian process can display "nonlinear" behavior and admits at least one nonlinear quantile representation conditional on past observations. On the contrary, causal model produces constant QAR estimates at any quantile. Some simulations have been conducted to illustrate this methodology. In the Monte Carlo experiment, we compare different specification tests for dynamic quantiles with Kolmogorov-Simirnov constancy test in terms of power. The methodology is applied to two empirical examples in stock markets. Moreover, this method can be used to test for noninvertibility in non-Gaussian moving average models. The potential estimation of noncausal processes using extreme quantiles is mentioned in the paper and need further investigation.
